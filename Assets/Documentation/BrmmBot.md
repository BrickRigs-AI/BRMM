## Uploading Mods too BRMM:

To start uploading mods to BRMM, check the following:
- Make sure you are on a server with the BRMM bot.
- Ensure you have access to the bot.

To upload a mod to BRMM, type **/upload** and search for the command from the BRMM bot. When you find it, you will see the following inputs:
- `name` Mod Name
- `name2` Mod Descryption
- `name3` Logo imge
- `name4` Big imge
- `name5` Google Drive link
- `name6` [raw .html file link](https://github.com/ControllerPog/BrmmModersTemplate)
- `caregory` Category
- `version` Version

When you feel that you are ready, just send the command, and you should see your mod on BRMM. (Your .zip file might take a while to upload.)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you are uploading a mod to BRMM, make sure the Google Drive link is visible to everyone.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to update a mod, just type the name of the mod into the `name` input and fill out the rest.
> Do not create a new mod if it is just an update of an existing one. (I will just remove it too save space)

If you have any issues with the bot, you can DM me on Discord (Mr Microcontroller).
