- Load Mods into gui.
- Auto find Brick Rigs install path.
- Install and/or extract mods to those paths.
- Create Modpacks for BrickRigs.
- Display prompts about if the mod is installed/not, etc.

Once you've installed BRMM, you can run it and enjoy it!

> [!TIP]
> If you're looking for the code to log in to BRMM, join this [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JnhTBsAgqv) and run the **/code** command to get the code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BRMM needs to be run as an administrator to work properly.
> (I know it's kind of annoying, but I will fix it in the next update.)
