## Running BRMM From Source Code:

The source code is included in `src` folder.

To open the BRMM from source, you'll need:
- `Visual Studio`
- `.Net Framework 4.7.2`
- `webview2` aka Bootstrapper

> [!TIP]
> If the project says that it is missing dependencies, you can redownload this NuGet dependencies:
>  ```
> Microsoft.Web.WebView2
> Newtonsoft.Json
> System.IO.Compression.ZipFile
> ```

Instructions to install things via `pip` can be found [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

Once you're done with everything, you should be able to simply open BrmmSlim.sln.
