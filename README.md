## System Requirements:

```
Windows 10/11, 64 bit
Brick Rigs, version 1.6+

## What is This?

This is BRMM, an unofficial, 'plug and play' mod management solution for Brick Rigs. It can:
- Load Mods into gui.
- Auto find Brick Rigs install path.
- Install and/or extract mods to those paths.
- Create Modpacks for BrickRigs.
- Display prompts about if the mod is installed/not, etc.
  
For those concerned about this app, a [privacy policy](https://github.com/anonymous-editor/BRMM/blob/main/Documentation/PRIVACYPOLICY.md) and [terms and conditions document](https://github.com/anonymous-editor/BRMM/blob/main/Documentation/T%26C.md) are included.

## Getting Started with BRMM:

To start with BRMM, you need to download the installer from the 'Releases' page or from [this link](https://github.com/anonymous-editor/BRMM/releases/latest).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BRMM needs to be run as an administrator to work properly. (I know it's kind of annoying, but I will fix it in the next update.)
